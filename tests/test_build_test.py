"""Tests for scripts/build_test.py, the parallel TEST copy of the race officer page and marks.php.

    python tests/test_build_test.py

Builds from the repository's page into a throwaway folder and checks the result, then feeds the script pages
altered in ways it must refuse and checks that it writes nothing:

  0  build      the test page talks only to /marks-test/, prefixes every browser storage key with "test-", shows
                the red TEST banner with its PAGE_VERSION, "TEST" in the title and noindex; marks.php is copied
                byte for byte; nothing else in the page changed; BUILD.txt names the version and both hashes
  1  live page  the live page itself uses no browser storage key without STORE (so a key added later is caught), and
                the STORE+ key names in its code are exactly STORE_NAMES (a key added or dropped must update the list)
  2  refusals   a storage key without STORE (setItem, getItem, removeItem), any other use of localStorage or
                sessionStorage (bracket access, .clear(), .key(), an alias, window['localStorage'],
                window.localStorage, typeof, passing it as an argument), IndexedDB, document.cookie (also
                document['cookie']), the Cache API, a service worker, a stray "/marks/" path, a missing or doubled
                key.js tag, a missing STORE line, a missing <title>: each is refused, exits non-zero and leaves an
                earlier build in the output folder untouched; a division followed by a call on the same line
                ((a+b)/2;localStorage.setItem('x',1) and var h=x/y;sessionStorage.getItem('z')) does not hide the call
  3  allowed    the same words in comments only, a regex literal holding a quote and "//" before a prefixed call,
                and the two division lines with STORE+ keys, still build
  4  saves      static guards for the course save status in the live page (2026-10-06.25; STATUS A33, A34, A35, A29):
                #saveStatus and #dayAnyway once each; saveCourses has no empty catch, passes the 20 s limit and has its
                day-change mode; postFix reads the server's error, sets .status, keeps "server <status>" and can abandon
                a request; pull waits for a running save (DAY_WAIT_MS) and checks the day-change save's result before
                deleting the old day's courses, and records made for third days stop it too; Clear everything
                resets the save state and names saveStatus and
                dayAnyway; "Race key not loaded yet" has its save message; the comment above Check recorded marks says
                picked chips are saved. Guards, not proof: no JavaScript is run
  5  copy       static guards for "Copy for Sail Scoring" in the live page (2026-10-06.26; STATUS A37): #ccCopy once,
                labelled "Copy for Sail Scoring"; the "Copy legs for SailScoring" button, its line format and its
                copy code unchanged; ccDoc takes its legs from legPts with the leg table's figures and writes nothing;
                buildLegs calls setCC beside each setSS. Guards, not proof: no JavaScript is run
  6  A38        static guards for typed and pasted positions and the queue (2026-10-06.27; STATUS A38): the position
                reader takes ' ′ ’ as the minutes mark; a card row (tabs) is named by its short name; pasted positions
                are marked and get an id ("paste|") no server fix can have; each queued send has the 20 s limit, a
                refusal (400, 429) goes to the "Not sent" list and the queue carries on, anything else stops it;
                #notSent once, moved with the committee boat button, drawn on every render, reset by Clear everything;
                Clear everything counts "Not sent" fixes and pasted positions; the 8 nm flag is measured from
                51.82 N 8.27 W and only for typed and pasted positions; a missing mark stays a row ("Mark missing"),
                its legs are not measured, Copy for Sail Scoring names them INCOMPLETE and anchors on the first measured
                leg, and a row naming a fix that is gone keeps its reference; the count is split into recorded fixes and
                other marks, and flagged ones are "fixes and marks to check"; Copy for Sail Scoring's name is the race
                name first, then the warnings in short form, the full ones beside the button; the approved wording is
                present. 2026-10-06.28: the typing message follows its fix (sent, refused, waiting, sending again,
                removed), the line under Get latest marks splits recorded fixes and typed positions, and a pasted
                position's detail says it is a chip of its race. 2026-10-06.29: so does a typed position's, and no
                detail says "Not offered as a chip". Guards, not proof: no JavaScript is run
  7  A40, A45   static guards for fixed marks and far positions (2026-10-06.30; STATUS A40, A45): the embedded snapshot
                has all 63 marks of the Marks sheet, its authored routes and its courses are exactly v3.19's (frozen
                hashes), plus exactly 85 reversed routes, each the reverse of a one-way authored route; no Position
                Source, Source URL or Verification / Use text is in the page; Copy for Sail Scoring (ccDoc, setCC) and
                the SailScoring lines (setSS) are unchanged from 2026-10-06.29; card marks are added only where a mark
                is tapped, imported or named by a row (never every mark at once); the page never reverses a route itself;
                the Fixed marks fold is there, closed; the WhatsApp text has no analysis, wind, route notes or labels;
                the approved wording is present; far positions are named under Check recorded marks and drawn "off the
                plot". Guards, not proof: no JavaScript is run
  8  .31        static guards for the five fixes after Pat's test of 2026-10-06.30-test (STATUS A40): Course Card marks
                are not carried into later races' chips; every race drawn gets its All races switch (Course Card marks
                and the selected race's course too); the paste box and the typing box refuse a card mark's own name
                (laid marks excepted, no other names) and store nothing, the typing box before it asks for a position;
                a routing waypoint with nothing on one side is warned on its row, belongs to no leg and makes Copy for
                Sail Scoring INCOMPLETE (ccDoc changes by that one line only); the laid-mark notice's earlier total
                takes a leg through RO-chosen waypoints with roLeg. Guards, not proof: no JavaScript is run
  9  .32        static guards for the follow-ups after Pat's test of 2026-10-06.31-test (STATUS A40, A45): the WhatsApp
                heading's date is the Race day box (never S.date) and follows it at once; routing waypoints are not
                carried either; one line per refused name; the refusal's second sentence by kind (a buoy, or a point:
                Grassy Mid and the routing waypoints); no "(planning position)" or "(RIB fix …)" in the WhatsApp text;
                the laid-mark notice names each source in words and says when nothing moved; a far typed or pasted
                position is left out of the magnetic variation. Guards, not proof: no JavaScript is run
 10  .33        static guards for the changes of 13 October 2026 (STATUS A40, A46, A47, A11): a course with a missing
                mark or a leg not measured is held back from competitors (#sendWarn; WhatsApp, Share and Copy text each
                ask "Send anyway?"; all three greyed when there is nothing to send); Spit Bank Lighthouse (a fixed light)
                is a point in the refusal; a laid mark's pasted or typed fix named as such in its chip, position box and
                leg note; a × on a card-mark chip only while unused; Withdraw and Correct of a typed position (A46: the
                server actions, the confirmation, the in-use refusal, withdrawn fixes never loaded, rows following a
                correction); pasted positions in red where used with "Save to the race record", no duplicate saved, the
                card-name refusal applied (A47); a saved typed position counts for its laid mark; the magnetic variation
                for the Race day, not today (A11). Guards, not proof: no JavaScript is run
 11  .34        static guards for the changes after Pat's test of 2026-10-06.33-test (STATUS A11, A40, A45, A47): Share
                and Copy text greyed like WhatsApp when switched off; the magnetic variation from the World Magnetic Model
                (WMM2025, the 90 coefficient lines exactly as the official WMM.COF, by their SHA-256) at the map centre for
                the day loaded, never from the marks loaded; a far typed or pasted position in a course holds Send back;
                the WhatsApp heading's date is the day loaded, and a Race day changed but not loaded is said and holds Send
                back; a pasted line matching a saved position makes no chip and says so; typed and pasted positions are
                never checked for their age; a leg through RO-chosen waypoints names a laid mark's fix on the physical leg
                touching it; every start with a saved course is shown. Guards, not proof: no JavaScript is run
